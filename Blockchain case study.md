# Ethereum 2.0 is coming

## What is it
The invention of cryptocurrencies has provided a new way to make payments and investments. With cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology came into existence which is known to revolutionize the global markets. Blockchain, along with cryptocurrencies, is helping various industries like healthcare, banking, agriculture, and more. 

After Bitcoin, Ethereum is another cryptocurrency that has topped the charts and has passed in impressing people. Ethereum is recognized as the second-largest cryptocurrency that is also a currency but focuses more on technology. It functions on a completely decentralized software platform and allows decentralized apps to be built on it. Ethereum was the first version that was introduced in 2011, but now, an upgraded version of Ethereum has been introduced, known as Ethereum 2.0.

Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or “Serenity,” is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain which enhance the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the network. so that it can process more transactions and ease bottlenecks.


## Why This Matters

The upgraded version is made to work on increasing the transaction numbers, alleviating congestion, and high gas costs on the Ethereum network. Ethereum will meet the goals of becoming a transparent and open network for decentralized applications and finance (DeFi). 

## Why This May be Interesting

Ethereum used to work on a consensus method known as the proof-of-work method, but Ethereum 2.0 is built on sharding and Proof of stake mechanism.

What it means is Ethereum will be broken into 18 “Shards” that operate at the same time. Instead of settling all operations on one single blockchain, shard chains spread these operations across 64 new chains.This will drastically improve efficiency.

 Nevertheless, PoS is a much more energy efficient method of maintaining the network.

ETH2.0 will fundamentally change the current economics. In fact, the Ethereum update will completely erase the concept of mining.

## Things to Keep in Mind for a Case Study

* Ethereum mining will not end for quite a few years. Ethereum will retain mining on the main chain until at least 2020. The main ETH1 chain will continue to use mining and run parallel to the ETH2.0 chain. This is to ensure stability during the migration
* Shard Chains aren’t expected until 2022, but it is unclear exactly when.
* At the moment there is nothing you can do with ETH2, they are just “digital receipts”, and transactions or other features we have now on ETH won’t be available on ETH2 for probably years.
